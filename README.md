The app, Shortly, is a work-in-progress. It is a URL shortening app that uses an API that takes an URL that was entered in an input box and provides a shortened version of the URL. I am currently working on the API portion where I am having some difficulty displaying the final URL. I will post updated versions of my code as I make progress with finalizing the layout, working on the API, and working on the mobile version.
